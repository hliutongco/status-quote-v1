This game was an entry in the 2018 New York AT&T Entertainment Hackathon and was created within one day.

## Instructions

This is a two-player game with four rounds total. The first round goes to player one, then the next round should go to player two. The third round goes back to player one, and the fourth and final round goes to player two.

Upon starting the game, four video clips will play one after another. These videos contain famous scenes from movies.

At a certain point, each video clip will pause. At this point, the player has **five** seconds to guess the next line in the scene. **Say your guess out loud and stand close enough for your computer/device microphone to pick up your answer.**

Each player receives one point for each correct guess. Good luck!
